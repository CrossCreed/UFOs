### UFOs Summary
___

* One drawback of this webpage is that the Filter Search criterias look funny when the webpage is viewed in full. The Descriptions of each filter do not line up with the input boxes. To make this look more aesthetically pleasing, more formatting that adjusts each sections in place would be recommended.

Recommendations:

* Adding a "Clear" button to reset field criteria so users don't have to constantly click "UFO sightings" to refresh the webpage.
* Adding a drop-down menu for the options of each criteria, so users can pick from an already pre-loaded data set within the menu in case they don't know certain details of the data to search through.
