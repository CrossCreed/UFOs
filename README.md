# UFOs
JavaScript, Bootstrap, and UFOs Module 11

## Overview of UFOs with Javascript

### Purpose
___
The purpose of this analysis is to provide an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings recorded by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

The challenge adds filters for city, state, country and shape, in addition to the module filter of date. 
  
The data for the project is taken from the data.js file provided in **Module 11**.

### UFOs Results
___
The page has been updated to include multiple filters and enable users to select multiple criteria in their search of UFO sightings.

Once a user has updated one of the filter sections below, the page will automatically display the relevant data regarding the UFOs.

The webpage also contains placeholders to show potential users the format for the search criteria. 



### UFOs Summary
___

* One drawback of this webpage is that the Filter Search criterias look funny when the webpage is viewed in full. The Descriptions of each filter do not line up with the input boxes. To make this look more aesthetically pleasing, more formatting that adjusts each sections in place would be recommended. 


Recommendations:

* Adding a "Clear" button to reset field criteria so users don't have to constantly click "UFO sightings" to refresh the webpage.
* Adding a drop-down menu for the options of each criteria, so users can pick from an already pre-loaded data set within the menu in case they don't know certain details of the data to search through.
